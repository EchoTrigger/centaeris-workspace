# Deployment

## Build inputs

The Workspace checkout and one compatible Runtime Framework revision are both
required. The current Compose build accepts Runtime source through the named
`centaeris` build context. A release pipeline must materialize an exact revision
and use it for both Cargo and Docker builds.

Required images include API, Runtime Server, worker, Web, general execution, and
document processor. PostgreSQL and Redis use pinned upstream image digests.
Execution and document processing are normal runtime dependencies.

## Local start

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Fill every blank secret.
pwsh -File scripts/start-local.ps1
```

The start script builds required images, runs initialization, and starts the
persistent stack. One-shot image checks confirm required binaries exist; they
do not remain as background services.

## Initialization

`api-init` runs before API replicas. It validates or creates the installed
Plugin catalog, applies Django migrations, and bootstraps the configured
administrator. Initialization failure blocks rollout and must not clear the
Plugin volume.

The `gc` service runs the server-side lifecycle collector. Worker and Runtime
start only after their required dependencies become healthy.

## Production topology

Apply `docker-compose.prod.yml` with the base Compose file. It removes the API
host port and binds Web to host loopback. An external HTTPS reverse proxy is the
only public entry point. PostgreSQL, Redis, Runtime, worker, and test services
remain on internal networks.

The production override is a topology baseline, not a complete infrastructure
product. TLS certificates, host firewall, backups, monitoring, and secret
injection remain deployment responsibilities.

## Update

1. Back up PostgreSQL and persistent file volumes.
2. Build all images from one candidate source revision.
3. Render and inspect the final Compose configuration.
4. Run the release gate, including a fresh-database migration.
5. Stop new work, run initialization and migrations, then replace services.
6. Verify health, empty-Plugin operation, document processing, and one AgentRun.

Do not remove volumes as an update step. Rollback is valid only when old
services understand current data formats or a tested restore is performed.

## Stop

`docker compose down` stops containers and preserves named volumes. Adding
`--volumes` is destructive and is not part of routine stop or upgrade.

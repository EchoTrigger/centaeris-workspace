# Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development. Empty required secrets
fail at startup; the example file intentionally contains no usable secret.

## Required secrets

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | Django signing and security state |
| `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` | API-to-Runtime and worker internal authentication |
| `AGENT_RUN_AUTHORIZATION_SIGNING_KEY` | Immutable AgentRun authorization signatures |
| `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encryption of stored model and MCP credentials |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL service authentication |
| `BOOTSTRAP_SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD` | Initial administrator bootstrap |

Do not reuse these values across environments. They must not enter Git, image
layers, browser responses, Session logs, Plugin packages, or test artifacts.

## Service addresses

The bundled Compose deployment owns internal service addresses: PostgreSQL is
`postgres:5432`, Redis is `redis:6379`, and API is `api:8000`. Both API and worker
Runtime URLs derive from `RUNTIME_PORT`. These internal addresses are not `.env`
knobs. `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, published host ports, `API_BASE_URL`, and
`WEB_ORIGIN` remain deployment inputs.

Standalone processes still accept the application environment variables
`POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `REDIS_URL`, `RUNTIME_URL`, and
`API_INTERNAL_URL`. External databases or custom network layouts require an
explicit Compose override updating every affected consumer; the bundled topology
gate does not certify those custom overrides. Production uses an external HTTPS
reverse proxy. Do not expose internal service tokens or database ports through it.

## Storage and concurrency

- Compose shares one storage-root anchor between API/GC configuration and their
  named-volume targets, and one Plugin-root anchor between API/init configuration
  and API/init/Runtime mounts. They are not independently configurable in `.env`.
  Standalone API processes still require `STORAGE_ROOT` and `PLUGIN_CATALOG_ROOT`.
- `STORAGE_STREAM_LANES` and `STORAGE_STREAM_CHUNK_BYTES` bound file streaming.
- `REDIS_BROWSER_MAX_CONNECTIONS` bounds browser streaming connections per API
  process.
- `API_WORKERS` must remain within the validated range.
- `RUNTIME_POSTGRES_POOL_SIZE`, `RUNTIME_POSTGRES_CONTROL_POOL_SIZE`, and
  `RUNTIME_POSTGRES_LISTENER_LIMIT` independently bound ordinary operations,
  execution-control probes/transitions, and PostgreSQL job listeners in each
  Runtime process. Store and SessionLog clones share these budgets.
- `RUNTIME_POSTGRES_CHECKOUT_TIMEOUT_MS` bounds only waiting for a pool slot.
  `RUNTIME_POSTGRES_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` bounds only establishing a new database
  connection. Neither value is a statement or end-to-end request deadline.
- `REDIS_MAXMEMORY` bounds transient live state; Redis eviction does not delete
  PostgreSQL facts.

Invalid or unsafe budgets fail instead of falling back to an unbounded value.

### Execution admission and request capacity

| Variable | Default | Scope |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `EXECUTION_GLOBAL_LIMIT` | 8 | Leased/running hosted AgentRun lifecycle steps across worker and Runtime replicas |
| `EXECUTION_TENANT_LIMIT` | 4 | The same execution leases within one Workspace |
| `EXECUTION_GLOBAL_QUEUE_LIMIT` | 128 | Initially queued AgentRuns across API replicas |
| `EXECUTION_TENANT_QUEUE_LIMIT` | 32 | Initially queued AgentRuns within one Workspace |
| `EXECUTION_QUEUE_WAIT_SECONDS` | 300 | Maximum age before first execution; expiry requests semantic cancellation |
| `RUNTIME_HTTP_REQUEST_LIMIT` | 24 | Ordinary handlers per Runtime process, including long executions |
| `RUNTIME_HTTP_LISTENER_LIMIT` | 8 | Job wait handlers per Runtime process |
| `RUNTIME_HTTP_CONTROL_LIMIT` | 4 | Cancellation, heartbeat, and job-status handlers per Runtime process |
| `RUNTIME_HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 30 | Absolute handler response deadline for short ordinary RPCs |
| `RUNTIME_HTTP_CONTROL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 5 | Absolute control handler response deadline; also used by API/worker control clients |

All replicas sharing one database must use the same execution/admission limits.
The runtime job lease is the execution permit: yield and terminal transitions
release it; expired leases remain counted until lifecycle reconciliation.
`WORKER_SLOT_COUNT` remains a local worker-thread limit. The execution limits do
not count suspended sandbox containers, knowledge-processing jobs, or a parent's
internal subagents; they are not a total-container or total-process memory budget.
Parent logical waits release the lifecycle lease, avoiding a parent/child permit
deadlock. A single-Workspace perf run reaches the tenant limit before the global
limit; change its isolated environment explicitly when measuring another capacity.

Queue expiry is checked under the same AgentRun row lock as the first running
transition, and by the bounded lifecycle reconciler. Logical waits and recovery
backoff are excluded. Expired work cannot start user execution; committing its
cancelled terminal record still requires a lifecycle step and may occur later.
An unavailable Runtime leaves expiry pending and blocks that first transition.

Short/control deadlines include request-body reading and waiting for the blocking
handler after headers are parsed. AgentRun steps and knowledge processing keep
their lease/cancellation lifetime; job waits retain 20-second waits and a 25-second
HTTP deadline. Database checkout/connect and statement/lock waits receive the
remaining request budget. This is not a universal SQL or transaction execution
deadline: a blocking operation already underway may finish after the HTTP timeout.
It retains its HTTP permit and connection until it exits; a timeout is not evidence
of rollback and never authorizes replay of uncertain work.

The current initial database definitions include `execution_job_tenants` and the
API's `agent_run_initial_queue` partial index. Schema numbers stay at v1; existing
pre-release databases are not migrated or backfilled automatically. Isolated
verification must initialize the current schema, not reuse an incompatible one.

## Execution and processing

`SANDBOX_MEMORY_BYTES`, `SANDBOX_CPU_MILLI`, `SANDBOX_PIDS_LIMIT`, and
`SANDBOX_DATA_TMPFS_BYTES` define the authorized AgentRun profile.
`OCI_RUNTIME` selects the configured container runtime.

`RUNTIME_EXECUTION_RECOVERY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` defaults to 5 replacement preparation
attempts per AgentRun; the initial execution is excluded. Each attempt is recorded
under the current lifecycle lease before preparing a replacement. A failed
preparation or process restart does not refund it. Retry delays are 1, 2, 4, 8,
and 16 seconds with deterministic ±20% jitter; the worker yields until the Runtime's
`retryAtMs` deadline. Only checkpoint-covered execution can enter this path.
Unknown tool side effects are not retried.

Compose owns the processor image reference through one YAML anchor shared by
the build service and material Worker. The general execution image is shared
between its build service and Runtime.
`KNOWLEDGE_PROCESSOR_IMAGE` is not a Compose `.env` input. Both images are required
services; build them before starting their respective execution services.

`KNOWLEDGE_PROCESSOR_DEVICE` is exactly `cpu` or `gpu:0`. One value configures
both the build and material Worker (as MATERIAL_PROCESSOR_DEVICE). The Dockerfile derives the installation extra from
that device (`cpu` or `gpu`); do not supply a separate `PROCESSOR_EXTRA`.
The shared `local` image tag deliberately does not encode `gpu:0`. Rebuild after
a device change. GPU deployment additionally requires compatible host hardware
and drivers, and a Compose override granting exactly one visible GPU to the
processor spec service. Configuration checks alone are not a GPU execution
certification.
The Docker release gate compares actual built/runtime image IDs and the image's
embedded device, so an existing stale image cannot satisfy the check.

## Docker Engine transport

Runtime container management, exec and archives use one shared local Docker Engine client and
negotiates the API version at initialization. `DOCKER_HOST`, when supplied, must
name a `unix://` socket or `npipe://` named pipe. Otherwise the platform default
local endpoint is used. Nonempty `DOCKER_CONTEXT` and remote TCP endpoints fail
explicitly; there is no CLI fallback. Initialization failure requires
a Runtime restart after the endpoint is repaired.

Queries have a 5-second deadline; create/start/remove requests have a 30-second
deadline. At most two create requests are issued concurrently per Runtime
process, including time spent waiting for that local permit. These are per-call
limits, not a deadline for the entire preparation sequence or a fleet-wide quota.
An expired request can still have taken effect in the daemon and is inspected
before its result is accepted.

Processor batch containers use Engine wait/logs, retaining the existing 64 KiB
per stdout/stderr channel, specification timeout and processing timeout. Ordinary
exec drains stdout/stderr independently and retains 8 MiB per channel, with raw
byte counts and an explicit truncation diagnostic. Hook diagnostics retain their
64 KiB limit; helpers enforce their existing output limits. MCP keeps the shared
4 MiB raw-line budget. Snapshot and archive payloads are streamed with bounded
buffers, not collected into a whole-payload allocation.

Exec create/start have bounded API handshakes. Once attached, command deadlines
and cancellation remain the host's responsibility; stream closure is not proof
that the remote process stopped. Synchronous helper reads/writes have a 30-minute
idle ceiling; MCP does not inherit that ceiling as a session lifetime. Archive
upload has a 30-second request deadline and download reads a 30-second idle
deadline. Processor download additionally enforces maxOutputBytes plus the
existing 64 MiB manifest allowance and bounded tar overhead. Unknown write or
exec outcomes are not automatically replayed.

The Runtime image no longer contains Docker CLI. Debian production uses the
mounted local Unix socket and must pass the daemon gate on its deployed Engine
version. Host-side Compose and diagnostic scripts may still use Docker CLI.
No precreated pool is enabled.

## Email

Password-reset mail is disabled unless `PASSWORD_RESET_ENABLED=1` and the
separate mail-sender service has valid SMTP configuration. The API process does
not silently send mail through an unconfigured backend.

## Production review

Before deployment, set `DJANGO_DEBUG=0`, use explicit allowed hosts and web
origin, rotate all example values, verify HTTPS termination, and render the
complete Compose configuration with:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml config
```

# Contributing

## Before changing code

Open an issue before changing a public protocol, persisted schema, Plugin or
Skill contract, or architecture boundary. Small fixes that preserve those
contracts can proceed directly. Follow the repository rules in `AGENTS.md` and
the verification in `docs/eval/ReleaseGate.md`.

## Development

Use the locked toolchains and dependencies in the repository. Run the smallest
focused regression that proves the change, followed by the relevant portions of
the local gate:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/ci.ps1
```

Do not commit credentials, customer data, private deployment configuration,
concrete commercial extensions, generated build output, ignored test results,
or unrelated binary documents. Preserve required third-party license and NOTICE
files.

## Contribution licensing

Except where a file or notice says otherwise, Contributions to this repository
are made to Material licensed under `AGPL-3.0-only`.

This repository accepts Contributions under the checked-in
[Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1](DCO). Every contribution commit requires a
`Signed-off-by` trailer containing the contributor's name and email address:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Git can add this trailer automatically with `git commit --signoff`. The sign-off
is a certification under the DCO, not a GPG signature, copyright assignment,
CLA, or separate patent grant. It does not give the project steward a separate
right to place an external Contribution in a proprietary edition; that would
require a separate written license from its copyright holder.

## Third-party material

Do not submit code, documentation, media, model files, datasets, fonts, or other
material that you do not own unless the maintainer has approved the inclusion
and its license in advance. Identify the source, exact version or revision,
applicable license, local modifications, and required notices. Keep vendored
third-party material separate from original Centaeris source.

AI-assisted Contributions remain the submitter's responsibility. Review their
provenance and license risk, and do not submit output that reproduces material
you are not entitled to submit and certify under the DCO.

The Centaeris name, logo, and official visual identity are outside the software
license. Do not submit changes to them unless the project steward explicitly
requests that work under separate terms.
